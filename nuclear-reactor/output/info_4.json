When a reactor operates at a power level higher than a small percentage of its rated power, the fuel temperature increases significantly compared to the coolant temperature. This leads to a change in reactivity, which is quantified by the power coefficient.\n\nThe power coefficient accounts for the reactivity feedback in a reactor operating at power. It is derived by dividing the equation representing the reactivity change by an incremental power change. The power coefficient depends on factors such as the fuel and coolant temperatures, as well as the reactivity coefficients at those temperatures.\n\nIn summary, the power coefficient in a nuclear reactor describes the change in reactivity with respect to changes in power.

The temperature defect is the negative feedback reactivity that needs to be compensated for when bringing a reactor core from room temperature to the operating inlet temperature. This is achieved by adding an equal amount of reactivity through control rod withdrawal or other means.\n\nThe power defect, on the other hand, occurs as reactor power increases from the hot zero-power state to its rated level. A negative power coefficient causes the reactivity to decrease further. The power defect is determined by integrating the fuel and coolant temperature coefficients between inlet and full power conditions. Similar to the temperature defect, the control system must add an equal amount of reactivity to bring the reactor from zero to full power.\n\nExcess reactivity is defined as the reactivity that would exist if all movable control poisons were instantly eliminated from the core. Large excess reactivities are undesirable as they require large amounts of neutron poisons to compensate for them.\n\nOverall, understanding power defects is crucial for controlling reactivity and ensuring safe and stable operation of nuclear reactors.",
